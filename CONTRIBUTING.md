## Kubernetes setup

You need to have a kubernetes environment to deploy a helm chart.
You can create in your local computer by using minikube, or you can use 
cloud providers to create one for you. 

## Building Documentation

Use `helm` (version 3) to build and debug your package

## Creating a pull request

Once you are satisfied with your changes:
